# AdLad Dummy Plugin

This plugin allows you to easily test your AdLad implementation in your games.
While developing and testing your game, you don't want too much third party code running on your page.
These tend to clutter your console and make unnecessary network requests.

You may choose to disable all AdLad plugins during development, but this means you won't be able to easily test ad implementations.

This dummy plugin can be used during development to show short (1.5s) ads when an AdLad call is made.
Additionaly, you can configure the plugin to return specific results for AdLad calls.
